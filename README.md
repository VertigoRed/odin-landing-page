Progress Review:

Overall I found the flexbox section quite difficult. I spent much longer than other lessons researching Flexbox and completing all of the supplementary lessons and games. 
For whatever reason the process of shaping and sizing content on the page wasn't quite connecting with me fully. 

The zombie Flex game helped me massively, mainly because it gave me the ability to practice these things over and over again. 

In regards to this project, I am happy with the end result. I do feel that there is a lot of code within that is probably unecessary. In that I have specified widths and heights, possibly where I need not have done so. I may have used far more containers then what is considered normal for these types of projects.

 I think my ideas of best practices need work, my naming conventions were all over the place and the HTML does not feature a single comment. This is something I will bear in mind and improve upon going forward, as commenting my CSS (however haphazardly), helped massively. 

 Finally, I really enjoy the process of GIT, but I need to work at it more to ensure I'm making more valuable commits. sometimes I struggled with wording as well as when to commit. Should my commits be more logical and based upon which section I have finished? Or should I simply list every change no matter the section, if for example I spot an error whilst working on something else.

 in conclusion, I am pleased with my progress thus far and I'm excited to learn more. I am rather proud of myself for having the wherewithal to stick with it and fully intend to follow through. I am particularly pleased with taking the time to work through every supplementary excercise and the knowledge I gained from them.
